## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed to detect **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**.

Unlike traditional signature-based systems, our solution uses a **Random Forest Ensemble** to identify "Living-off-the-Land" (LotL) attacks that blend in with normal traffic. The system features a novel **Dynamic Thresholding** mechanism that adjusts detection sensitivity in real-time based on network entropy, allowing it to catch "low-and-slow" data exfiltration attempts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `apt_detection_advanced.py` | **Main Engine.** Generates synthetic data, trains the Random Forest model, and produces analysis plots (ROC, Confusion Matrix, 3D PCA). |
| `dynamic_threshold_simulator.html` | **Interactive Dashboard.** A web-based simulator that visualizes the "Dynamic Threshold" innovation. It can load the CSV data generated by the Python script. |
| `CIC_IDS2017_Synthetic.csv` | **Dataset.** The high-fidelity synthetic network traffic data generated by the Python script (Isomorphic to CIC-IDS2017). |
| `apt_analysis_results.png` | **Results.** The output image containing the Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and 3D Clusters. |
